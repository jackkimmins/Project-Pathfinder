# Project-Pathfinder
My simple pathfinding algorithm that navigates between two points and avoids obstacles.

This project is nothing serious and I wouldn't suggest using it for anything important. Basically, it randomly generates a terrain grid and disperses several obstacles in the form of the letter 'X'. Then the pathfinder tries to navigate the most optimal path between the randomly set start and end points. On every step, it checks the 8 tiles surrounding its current position. Whatever tile has the lowest cost value and is not an obstacle is the one that it will pick.
